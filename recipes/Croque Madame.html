        <h1>Croque Madame</h1>
        <img src="../recipes/images/croque.jpg" width="300"height="250" >
        <p>A classic croque madame makes the perfect French-inspired <p>brunch or lunch dish. Once you try this, </p>
        <p>it will be hard to have "just" a ham and cheese sandwich again</p>.
        <p> Don't cheat and use Swiss cheese,</p> 
        <p>this deserves the real thing! Using Gruy√®re cheese will make all the difference.</p>
        <br>
